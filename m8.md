AI Development Prompt: M8 - Tier 1 Content Generation (Browser Dev Tools)

ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objective
Your task is to create the complete content module for the next Tier 1 technology: Browser Developer Tools. You must generate a new file, src/data/devtools.js, and integrate it into the application.

ðŸ“œ Mandatory Adherence to Documentation
This task must be executed with strict and complete adherence to the project's foundational document: AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md. Before writing any code, you must re-read and internalize all guidelines within this document, paying special attention to the following recently added sections:

Content Generation Guidelines: All generated text must be engaging, use analogies, and focus on the "why." The tone must be conversational and suitable for novices.
Lesson Content Presentation: The data structure you create must support the UI standards for rendering distinct sections for content, key topics, and code examples.
Security & Privacy Requirements: You must not re-introduce security risks. Any HTML in content strings must be properly escaped (e.g., &lt;div&gt; instead of <div>).
ðŸ”„ Execution Workflow
You must follow this workflow precisely. Do not deviate.

Step 1: Create Browser Dev Tools Content Module

Create a new file at src/data/devtools.js.
Populate this file with the complete content for the Browser Dev Tools module, following the exact data structure defined in AI_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md and exemplified by the existing content modules.
The content must be comprehensive, covering topics like the Elements panel (inspecting and editing HTML/CSS), the Console (logging and debugging), the Network tab (monitoring requests), and the Performance tab (profiling).
Ensure all content meets the quality and tone standards defined in the "Content Generation Guidelines."
Step 2: Integrate the New Module

Update src/data/lessons.js to import and include the new devtoolsContent module.
Step 3: Update the Development Plan

Immediately after successfully creating and integrating the module, you must edit DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md.
In the "Content Generation Checklist" table, update the "Browser Dev Tools" row by marking all columns as complete ([x]).
Step 4: Final Adherence Check

After updating the plan, perform a final self-review.
Briefly re-read your generated src/data/devtools.js file and confirm that it complies with all documented guidelines (content tone, data structure, HTML escaping).
State your confirmation of this check in your final response.
âœ… Success Criteria
The devtools.js file is created and populated with high-quality, standards-compliant content.
The application runs correctly with the new Browser Dev Tools module available in the learning path.
DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md is accurately updated to reflect the completion of the module.
Your final response confirms that the adherence check was completed.
