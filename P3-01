**Objective:** Implement the Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature for lesson content.

**Tasks:**
1.  **Integrate a TTS Library:**
    *   Research and select a suitable and simple client-side TTS library (e.g., the browser's built-in `SpeechSynthesis` API is a good first choice).
    *   Install any necessary packages if required.

2.  **Create a TTS Service/Utility:**
    *   Create a new file `src/utils/tts.js`.
    *   This utility will encapsulate the TTS logic, including functions to speak, pause, and cancel speech.
    *   It should handle the browser's `SpeechSynthesis` API.

3.  **Develop the `TTSButton` Component:**
    *   Create a new component `src/components/common/TTSButton.jsx`.
    *   This component will display play/pause/stop buttons.
    *   It will manage the state of the TTS playback (e.g., `isPlaying`, `isPaused`).
    *   It will take the text to be spoken as a prop.

4.  **Integrate `TTSButton` into `LessonView`:**
    *   Modify `src/components/learning/LessonView.jsx`.
    *   Add the `TTSButton` component near the lesson title or content.
    *   Pass the lesson's content to the `TTSButton`.
    *   Ensure the TTS functionality works when a lesson is viewed.

5.  **Update `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`:**
    *   After successful implementation and testing, mark the "Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality" task as complete.

6.  **Final Adherence Check:**
    *   Review all new and modified files (`tts.js`, `TTSButton.jsx`, `LessonView.jsx`) to ensure they adhere to project standards, are well-documented, and contain no linting errors.
