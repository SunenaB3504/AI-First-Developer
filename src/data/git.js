      content: "Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Think of it as a 'save' button for your entire project, allowing you to undo mistakes, see who made changes, and manage different versions of your work. Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world.",

      title: "Getting Started: Installation and Configuration",
      content: "Before you can use Git, you need to install it on your computer. Once installed, you should configure your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating.",

      title: "The Basic Git Workflow",
      content: "The core of the Git workflow consists of three stages. First, you modify files in your working directory. Second, you stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area. Finally, you commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.",

      title: "Branching and Merging",
      content: "Branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. This is perfect for developing new features or fixing bugs. Once your work is complete, you can merge your branch back into the main branch.",

      content: "Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the internet or network somewhere.

  toolsRequired: ["Git CLI", "Text Editor / IDE", "GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket Account (Optional)"],
  bestPractices: [
    "Commit often and write clear, descriptive commit messages.",
    "Use branches for new features and bug fixes to keep the main branch clean.",
    "Pull regularly from the remote repository to stay up-to-date with changes from others.",
    "Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from version control."
  ],
  commonPitfalls: [
    "Forgetting to stage files before committing.",
    "Committing large binary files or sensitive data.",
    "Working directly on the main/master branch for new features.",
    "Force pushing (`git push -f`) without understanding the consequences, as it can overwrite history."
  ],
  careerRelevance: "Git is the industry standard for version control. Proficiency in Git is a mandatory skill for virtually every software development job. It is fundamental for collaboration, code management, and deploying applications. Without Git skills, it is nearly impossible to work on a modern development team."
