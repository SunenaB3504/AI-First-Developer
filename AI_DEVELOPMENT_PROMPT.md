### **Content Generation Guidelines**

To ensure the learning material is effective and engaging for novices, all generated content must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Engaging and Relatable Tone:**
    - **Use Analogies:** Explain complex technical concepts using simple, real-world analogies (e.g., "HTML is the skeleton of a website").
    - **Conversational Style:** Write in a friendly, encouraging, and conversational voice. Avoid overly academic or dry language.

2.  **Focus on the "Why":**
    - **Explain Purpose:** Don't just describe *what* a feature does; explain *why* it's useful and *when* a developer would need it.
    - **Contextual Examples:** Provide practical examples that connect to a real-world problem the learner might want to solve.

3.  **Technical Accuracy and Readability:**
    - **Escape Inline HTML:** When displaying HTML tags as text within a content description (e.g., explaining what a `<p>` tag is), they **must** be properly escaped (e.g., `&lt;p&gt;`). This prevents the browser from rendering the tag and breaking the UI.
    - **Clear Code Snippets:** Code examples should be concise, well-commented, and directly relevant to the concept being taught.

4.  **Logical Progression:**
    - **Build on Concepts:** Structure sections so that they build upon one another, creating a smooth learning curve from basic to advanced topics.
