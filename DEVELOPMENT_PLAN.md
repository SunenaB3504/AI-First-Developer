    *   [ ] Set up development environments (Web & Mobile).
    *   [ ] Initialize project structure and version control (Git).
    *   [x] Implement core UI layout and navigation components (Header, Footer, Side/Bottom Nav).
    *   [ ] Develop the user authentication system (Firebase Auth: email, social logins).
    *   [x] Create user profile management pages.
    *   [ ] Build the backend infrastructure for progress tracking (Firestore database schema).

#### **Phase 2: Core Learning Experience (Weeks 5-8)**

*   **Objective**: Build the main learning features and populate the initial content.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content**: Develop and integrate all content for Tier 1 technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
    *   [ ] **Features**:
        *   [ ] Create the interactive tutorial and lesson interface.
        *   [ ] Develop the real-time code playground with instant feedback.
        *   [ ] Integrate the basic AI prompt system for personalized guidance.
        *   [ ] Implement the progress tracking UI (progress bars, chapter completion status).

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features & Content Expansion (Weeks 9-12)**

*   **Objective**: Enhance the platform with advanced features and expand the curriculum.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content**: Develop and integrate all content for Tier 2 and Tier 3 technologies.
    *   [ ] **Features**:
        *   [ ] Implement Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality for audio learning.
        *   [ ] Develop the project portfolio builder where users can showcase their work.
        *   [ ] Enhance the AI system for smarter content and technology recommendations.
        *   [ ] Implement the gamification system (badges, learning streaks).

#### **Phase 4: Professional Tools & Deployment (Weeks 13-16)**

*   **Objective**: Finalize all web content, deploy the web application, and implement professional-grade tools.
*   **Key Tasks**:
    *   [ ] **Content**: Develop and integrate all content for Tier 4 and Tier 5 technologies.
    *   [ ] **Platform**:
