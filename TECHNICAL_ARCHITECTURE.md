# Technical Architecture Document

---

This document outlines the technical architecture for the **Technology Prompts Library App**. It serves as the primary reference for all technology stack, infrastructure, and platform-specific decisions.

## 1. Core Architecture Philosophy

- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**: Leverage Firebase to accelerate backend development, focusing resources on the frontend and user experience.
- **Cross-Platform First**: Utilize frameworks like React Native to maintain a single codebase for mobile, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Design all systems with modularity in mind to ensure maintainability and future scalability.

## 2. Frontend Stack

| Area | Technology | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Application** | HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript | Core web technologies. The architecture should be upgradeable to a framework like React in the future. |
| **Mobile Application**| React Native | A single codebase for both iOS and Android native applications. |
| **UI Framework** | Material Design | Used for base components and design language, with custom theming for a unique brand identity. |
| **State Management** | Context API | Combined with local storage for state persistence and synchronization across sessions. |
| **Design Approach** | Responsive, Mobile-First | The UI must be optimized for mobile devices first and then scale gracefully to desktop layouts. |

## 3. Backend Infrastructure (Firebase)

| Service | Firebase Product | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Backend** | Firebase with Cloud Functions | For serverless backend logic, such as processing user data or handling complex queries. |
| **Database** | Firestore | A NoSQL, document-based database for storing user data, progress, preferences, and application content. |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth | To manage user sign-up, login, and sessions. Supports email/password and social logins (Google, etc.). |
| **File Storage** | Firebase Storage | For storing user-generated content and media files (e.g., profile pictures, project assets). |
| **Analytics** | Firebase Analytics | To track user engagement, feature usage, and learning patterns. |

## 4. Platform-Specific Requirements

### Web Application
- **PWA Capabilities**: Must include service workers for offline access, caching strategies, and a manifest file to be "installable."
- **Browser Compatibility**: Full support for the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **SEO Optimization**: Implementation of meta tags, structured data (schema.org), and an auto-generated sitemap for search engine visibility.

### Mobile Applications (iOS & Android)
- **Native Features**: The app must leverage native device capabilities via React Native, including:
    - Push Notifications for reminders and updates.
    - Camera access for profile pictures or project submissions.
    - Biometric Authentication (Face ID, Touch ID) for secure login.
- **App Store Compliance**: Adherence to all Apple App Store and Google Play Store guidelines for submission and approval.
- **Performance**: Optimized for 60fps animations and fast startup times.

## 5. Security & Privacy

| Area | Requirement | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Protection** | GDPR Compliance | Ensure user data rights (access, deletion) are respected. |
| **Authentication** | Secure & Multi-Factor | Implement strong password policies and offer Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via Firebase Auth. |
| **Data Transit** | End-to-End Encryption | All data transmitted between the client and Firebase services is encrypted by default (HTTPS). |
| **API Security** | Secure Endpoints | All Cloud Functions must be protected with authentication checks and rate limiting to prevent abuse. |
| **Code Security** | Code Sanitization | Sanitize all user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and injection attacks. |
| **Backup Strategy**| Disaster Recovery | Regular backups of the Firestore database must be configured to allow for disaster recovery. |
